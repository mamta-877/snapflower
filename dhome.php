                        <strong>What types of photography do we do?</strong> Some photographers do a little of everything. Others specialize in one type of
                        photography or another. The first thing that people are going to want to know is what
                        kind of services you offer. If they are looking for a family photographer or someone to
                        do their son's senior portraits, for example, they wouldn't want to work with a
                        wedding photographer.

                        <strong>Why should we hire a professional photographer?</strong>This is the million-dollar question. People want to know exactly what it is that sets
                        you apart and makes you worth their time. This is your place to make it known. Explain
                        all the benefits of working with a professional, including the fact that you won't have
                        to worry about one of your family members or friends missing out on whatever event
                        is being captured because they are the one manning the camera.

                        <strong>Are deposits refundable?</strong>If you're like most professional photographers, you take a deposit with each booking
                        to provide a little security and peace of mind. This holds people accountable and
                        shows them the value of your time. What happens, though, when there's an
                        emergency or something comes up that requires rescheduling or cancellation? Do
                        you keep deposits? Perhaps you only keep part of them.

                        consuming process of editing and proofing photos before they can be delivered to the
                        client. Make sure that you not only explain how long clients should expect to wait, but
                        why the wait takes that much time so that they are aware of what they are paying.

                        physical photos. Moreover, some photographers only work with certain mediums in
                        the same regard, for one reason or another. Therefore, most people will ask if digital
                        images are available if they want them. However, they may not always be an option. Be
                        sure to advise as to whether you offer digital images with prints or in any other capacity.
